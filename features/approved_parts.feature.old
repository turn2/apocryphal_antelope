Feature: Adding approved parts
  In order to show positive impact from the program
  As a wholesaler participating in the event
  I want to be able to add approved part sales

  Background:
    Given a wholesaler "Joe's Wholesaler"
    And I am signed in with the account for the wholesaler "Joe's Wholesaler"

  Scenario: Enter approved sales
    Given I go to my dashboard
    And I follow "Manage Product Sales"
    When I enter information about an approved part sale
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Sales data received. You will receive an entry into the sweepstakes for each approved sale"
    And the approved part sale should be attributed to the wholesaler "Joe's Wholesaler"
